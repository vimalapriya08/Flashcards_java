<p>In Stage 1, we learnt how to create a dynamic flashcard from user's input. Let’s add a primitive guessing mechanism as well so that the user can check how well they remember the definitions.</p>
<p>For this stage you'll extend the flashcard-creation mechanism implemented in Stage 1 and add a functionality to check the user's answer on top of it.</p>
<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>
<p>Similar to Stage 1, your program should read two lines from the console, a <em>term,</em> and a <em>definition, </em>that represent a card. However there's no need to print <code class="java">Card:</code> or <code class="java">Definition:</code> in this stage.</p>
<p>After that, the user inputs a line as an <em>answer</em> (a definition of the term on the card). Compare the user's answer with the correct definition and print the result. </p>
<p>The output of the program must be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">Your answer is wrong...</code> if the answer doesn't match the definition;</li>
<li><code class="java">Your answer is right!</code> if the answer matches the definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, at this point, the user is unlikely to get the answer wrong, since they’re the ones who just typed in the answer... But don’t worry: right now we're just warming up so that in later stages we could make this a bit more challenging for our users.</p>
<h5 id="examples" style="text-align: center;">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>the user's answer is correct</em></p>
<p>Input (a term, then a definition, and, finally, an answer):</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; print()
&gt; outputs text
&gt; outputs text
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Your answer is right!
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2: </strong><em>the user's answer is incorrect</em></p>
<p>Input (a term, a definition, an answer):</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; Jetbrains
&gt; A place for people who love to code
&gt; A place for people who hate to code
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Your answer is wrong...</code></pre>
